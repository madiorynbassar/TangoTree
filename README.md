# TangoTree
A tango tree is a type of binary search tree proposed by Erik D. Demaine, Dion Harmon, John Iacono, and Mihai Pătrașcu in 2004.[1] It is named after Buenos Aires, of which the tango is emblematic.

It is an online binary search tree that achieves an {\displaystyle O(\log \log n)}O(\log \log n) competitive ratio relative to the offline optimal binary search tree, while only using {\displaystyle O(\log \log n)}O(\log \log n) additional bits of memory per node. This improved upon the previous best known competitive ratio, which was {\displaystyle O(\log n)}O(\log n).
